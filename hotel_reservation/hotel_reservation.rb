The ABC Propertiers company manages various hotels across various hill stations. They want to implement a customer-reservation system.
They'd like their customers to know prices across various hotels in various hill stations -
The prices are determined by a basic rate or a special season rate.
Some units have seasonal rates (e.g. a new year rate and a summer rate)

Write a program that parses a list of rentals in json format and outputs with their names.

When the user enters their period of reservation, the total cost for the reservation period is displayed, grouped by normal rate period and any season period days in between.
